        "# Advanced RAG Retrieval Strategies: Enhancing Document Relevance\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook explores advanced techniques for improving the relevance of retrieved documents in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We will build a basic RAG ingestion pipeline and then compare different retrieval strategies, including standard similarity search, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), a custom enhanced re-ranking method, and Cohere's re-ranking API.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to demonstrate how these techniques can help find the most relevant \"needles\" in a large document \"haystack\" for a given query, ultimately leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses from a language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pipeline Overview:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Installation:** Install necessary libraries (LangChain, ChromaDB, PyPDF, BeautifulSoup4, LangChain-Community, LangChain-Chroma, Cohere).\n",
        "2.  **Setup & Ingestion:** Load a PDF document, split it into chunks, embed the chunks using an OpenAI model, and store them in a ChromaDB vector store. This process creates the searchable knowledge base.\n",
        "3.  **Basic Retrieval (Similarity Search):** Perform a standard similarity search to retrieve chunks based on vector similarity to the query.\n",
        "4.  **Advanced Retrieval (MMR):** Implement and test Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), which balances relevance and diversity in retrieved results.\n",
        "5.  **Advanced Retrieval (Re-ranking):** Implement and test re-ranking strategies, both a custom manual approach and using Cohere's re-ranking model (if available), to reorder initially retrieved candidates based on their relevance to the query.\n",
        "6.  **Evaluation:** Compare the performance of different retrieval strategies using both a custom relevance scoring function and an external evaluation using the OpenAI API to assess how well each strategy retrieves relevant chunks.\n",
        "7.  **Visualization:** Visualize the evaluation results to clearly show the performance differences between the strategies."

This is crucial because embedding models and language models have token limits. We define a `chunk_size` (maximum characters per chunk) and `chunk_overlap` (to maintain context between chunks).\n",
        "5.  **Embed and Store:** Initialize the `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. Then, use `Chroma.from_documents` to process the chunks. This method handles two steps:\n",
        "    *   It sends each chunk to the `embedding_model` to get its vector representation.\n",
        "    *   It stores the original chunk text and its corresponding vector in the `ChromaDB` vector store.\n",
        "6.  **Persist Vector Store:** We configure `ChromaDB` to store the database persistently on disk in the `./chroma_db_rag` directory. A fix is included to remove the directory if it already exists, preventing potential `KeyError` issues during re-ingestion.\n",
        "7.  **Verification:** Perform a simple similarity search query to verify that the vector store has been created and can retrieve documents."
